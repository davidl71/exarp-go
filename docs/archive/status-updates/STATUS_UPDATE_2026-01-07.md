## Next Actions

1. **Add Research Comments to Todo2** (Optional)
   - Research comments are prepared in `docs/INDIVIDUAL_TOOL_RESEARCH_COMMENTS.md`
   - Can be added to Todo2 tasks (T-22 through T-45) as `research_with_links` comments
   - Or referenced from shared document during implementation

2. **Begin Implementation**
   - Start with T-NaN (Go project foundation)
   - Use prepared research for all tool implementations
   - Follow sequential implementation pattern
