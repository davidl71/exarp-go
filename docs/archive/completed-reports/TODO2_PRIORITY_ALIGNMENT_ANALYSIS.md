## Insights

**Alignment Score: 100.0%**
🚨 4 tasks violate Tool Count Limit constraint (≤30)
   Current tool count: 30/30
   Recommendation: Consolidate tools or use resources instead


## Design Constraint Violations

**Tool Count Limit (≤30 tools)**

The following tasks would create new tools and violate the design constraint:

- **T-58**: Phase 1: Analyze and inventory remaining tools to migrate
  - Priority: high
  - Issue: Would create new tool when already at limit (30/30)
  - Recommendation: Consider consolidating with existing tools or using resources instead

- **T-59**: Phase 2: Design migration strategy and architecture
  - Priority: high
  - Issue: Would create new tool when already at limit (30/30)
  - Recommendation: Consider consolidating with existing tools or using resources instead

- **T-60**: Phase 3: Migrate high-priority tools (batch 1)
  - Priority: high
  - Issue: Would create new tool when already at limit (30/30)
  - Recommendation: Consider consolidating with existing tools or using resources instead

- **T-61**: Phase 4: Migrate remaining tools (batch 2)
  - Priority: medium
  - Issue: Would create new tool when already at limit (30/30)
  - Recommendation: Consider consolidating with existing tools or using resources instead
