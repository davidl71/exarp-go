## Deliverables

### Research Documents
1. **Shared Reference:** `docs/SHARED_TOOL_MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md`
   - Complete research synthesis
   - Implementation patterns
   - Best practices
   - Common migration strategies

2. **Individual Comments:** `docs/INDIVIDUAL_TOOL_RESEARCH_COMMENTS.md`
   - Tool-specific research for each task
   - Ready to add to Todo2 as `research_with_links` comments
   - Includes all required sections

3. **Verification Documents:**
   - `docs/RESEARCH_VERIFICATION_SUMMARY.md`
   - `docs/RESEARCH_COMMENTS_ADDED_SUMMARY.md`
   - `docs/RESEARCH_PHASE_COMPLETE.md`

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Add Research Comments to Todo2**
   - Copy research comments from `docs/INDIVIDUAL_TOOL_RESEARCH_COMMENTS.md`
   - Add as `research_with_links` comments to each task (T-22 through T-45)
   - Reference shared document: `docs/SHARED_TOOL_MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md`

2. **Begin Implementation**
   - Start with T-NaN (Go project foundation)
   - Use prepared research for all tool implementations
   - Follow sequential implementation pattern

### Implementation Readiness

- ✅ All research complete
- ✅ Research comments prepared
- ✅ Documentation comprehensive
- ✅ Ready for implementation phase
