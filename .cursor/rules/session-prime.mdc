# 🚀 Automatic Session Priming

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Auto-Prime Session at Conversation Start ⚠️**

## Mandatory Session Priming

**At the START of EVERY new conversation in Cursor, you MUST:**

1. **Automatically call the session prime tool** before responding to the user's request:
   ```json
   {
     "action": "prime",
     "include_hints": true,
     "include_tasks": true
   }
   ```
   For maximum context, use `ask_preferences: true` when the client supports MCP elicitation—prompts the user for include_tasks/include_hints preferences at prime time.

2. **Use the primed context** to inform your responses and understanding of the project state

3. **Include the primed information** in your initial response to provide context-aware assistance

## When to Prime

- ✅ **Every new conversation** - Prime at the very start
- ✅ **After long breaks** - If conversation has been idle, prime again
- ✅ **When switching contexts** - Prime when user changes topics significantly

## What Session Prime Provides

The `session(action="prime")` tool provides:
- **Agent type detection** - Identifies your role (backend, web, security, general)
- **Mode detection** - Suggests optimal workflow mode based on time of day
- **Task summary** - Recent tasks and current project status
- **Tool hints** - Relevant tools for detected mode
- **Plan path** - Path to current .plan.md file when one exists
- **Plan Mode hint** - Suggests Cursor Plan Mode when backlog has many high-priority or dependency-heavy tasks
- **Handoff notes** - Messages from other developers/machines
- **Companion MCP status** - Checks for other MCP servers

## Implementation

**Example workflow:**
1. User sends first message
2. AI immediately calls `session(action="prime")` 
3. AI receives primed context
4. AI uses primed context to provide informed response
5. AI mentions key context points from prime (tasks, mode, handoffs)

## Benefits

- **Context-aware assistance** - Always know current project state
- **Multi-device coordination** - See handoffs from other machines
- **Optimal tool suggestions** - Get relevant tools for your mode
- **Task awareness** - Know what's in progress or needs attention

**Remember: Session priming is automatic and mandatory. Never skip it at conversation start.**
