# Make and shell shortcuts (exarp-go)

**Use these shortcuts when suggesting shell commands so the user can run less typing.**

## Makefile shortcuts

| Instead of           | Use      | When suggesting |
|----------------------|----------|------------------|
| `make build`         | `make b`  | Building the Go binary |
| (none)               | `make r`  | Print repo root (e.g. for scripts) |
| (none)               | `make root` | Same as `make r` |
| long path            | `cd $(make r)` | Change to project root from anywhere in repo |
| (none)               | `make tag-build-ok` | Tag current commit as last known-good build |

**Rules:**
- Prefer **`make b`** over `make build` in suggested commands and snippets.
- When a command must run from project root, suggest **`cd $(make r)`** first (or `r` if the user's shell has the alias).

## Shell alias (user's ~/.zshrc)

The user has in `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
alias r='cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)'
```

- **Interactive use:** You can suggest **`r`** to cd to repo root from any subdir (any git repo).
- **Scripts / non-interactive:** Prefer **`cd $(make r)`** so it works without relying on the alias.

## Checklist when suggesting commands

- [ ] Build → use `make b` (not `make build`).
- [ ] Need to be in project root → suggest `cd $(make r)` or `r` (interactive).
- [ ] Tag last good build → suggest `make tag-build-ok`.
