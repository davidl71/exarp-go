# Task cleanup skill

When the user asks to **remove one-off tasks**, **remove performance tasks**, or says those tasks **reappeared**, use the **task-cleanup** skill:

1. **Read** `.cursor/skills/task-cleanup/SKILL.md` for the ID lists and batch-delete pattern.
2. **Call** `task_workflow` with `action=delete` and `task_ids` (comma-separated) in one call instead of looping.

Batch delete example: `{"action":"delete","task_ids":"T-321,T-401,T-402,T-403"}` (one-off) or the performance IDs from the skill.
